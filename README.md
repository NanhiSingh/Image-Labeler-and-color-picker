# Image-Labeler-and-color-picker

This app is integrated with firebase image labeler and color picking from image feature.

The first page contains the two buttons for image labler and color picker feature.

In image labelling feature a user just has to click a photo using camera and then click on the "tick" button and then the image labeler detects the captured picture and labels it.

The second button is for color picking feature. On click that button, the user is routed to a new page 
which consists of an image and half bland white space where user can draw anything with touch gesture.
To pick the color from the image user has to tap and slide on the image to pick the respective color from the image.
